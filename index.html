            <h5 class="center"> Origins </h5>

            <p class="light"> Bubble Tea originated in the early 1980s in Taiwan when a food stall
            owner decided to combine already three popular elements tapioca bubbles,shaved ice,
            and milk tea. It became an instant hit in Taiwan. The tea became known as boba because the term is slang for breasts in Chinese (a reference the spherical shape of the tapioca balls).  </p>

            <h5 class="center">Tapioca Explained</h5>
            <p class="light"> Tapioca is a starch extracted from cassava root. Alternative names to tapioca are "Boba", "Pearls",
            and most common, "Bubbles". Bubbles include sweet potato powder, potato powder, or jelly. Tapioca size typically ranges
            from five to ten millimeters. Every bubble tea store adds their own spin on bubble tea and so there are abnomalies like
            one millimeter bubbles. Depending on added ingredients such as water, sugar, and seasoning, tapioca balls vary in color
            and texture.</p>

            <h5 class="center"> Development of Bubble Tea</h5>

            <p class="light"> Stall owners started introducing fruit boba, using fruit powders and syrups in lieu of actual fruit
            (which was too expensive and went bad quickly) The topping choices expanded beyond tapioca balls to include elements
            like grass jelly, almond jelly, egg pudding, and red beans. Even in classic boba, the milk in the milk tea was swapped
            out for non-dairy creamer because it was more shelf-stable, and as a result, the drink became known for its incredibly
            sweet, creamy taste. </p>

            <h5 class="center"> Boba Guys </h5>


          <p class="light"> Boba guys only serves the highest quality of Boba tea. All their ingredients are organic.
          Their boba has just the right amount of chewiness. In addition, Boba Guys only uses
          homemade syrup to sweeten their tea. This chain that sells the highest quality bubble tea also comes at a high price.
          The average price for a large drink at Boba's is about 8 dollars while Vivi's bubble tea is only 5 dollars.
          Boba guys for me is a luxary. I suggest that if you're looking for quality at a reasonable price, go to NYC Chinatown
          and explore for yourself. Boba Guys gets a 5 star rating from me. </p>

            <h5 class="center"> Vivi </h5>
             <p class="light">Bubble tea has become a staple in NYC. Every corner features a brand new spin on the popular sweet drink.
             Vivi's Bubble Tea is one of the many chain bubble tea stores that took an early advantage which jump started their success.
             I, as a bubble tea fanatic, have drank bubble tea for most of my life. Growing up in NYC has nurtured my affinity for bubble tea.
             Vivi's Bubble Tea has a unique sweetness and an ageless appeal. After trying the classic bubble tea at Vivi's, my belief is
             that Vivi's may be popular and well known, but uses sugar or sweetness to make up what it lacks for in taste. Overall, I would give
             their brand a 4 star rating. </p>

            <h5 class="center"> Classic Bubble Tea Shops in Chinatown </h5>
          <p class="light"> Many Chinatown bakeries offer bubble tea, but since these are small buisnesses often with one location, many go unnoticed.
          I'd like to give those bakeries the acknowledgement they deserve. Many of those small scale bakeries are now closing down
          due to increasing rent. This is devestating because they were the ones that started the bubble tea fad in Chinatown. Their
          milk tea is what I'd regard as the most authentic you can get in NYC. Their milk tea is the staple for many New Yorkers
          including myself. The price of their milk tea or bubble milk tea is often less than the price of chain bubble tea. Ofcourse,
          they are a 5 on my scale.</p>
